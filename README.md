CSS_FLEX

CSS Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout model designed to create flexible and responsive web layouts. It simplifies the process of aligning and distributing space among items in a container, making it easier to design complex layouts without the need for floats or positioning.
