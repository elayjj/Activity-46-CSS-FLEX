CSS_FLEX

CSS Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout model designed to create flexible and responsive web layouts. It simplifies the process of aligning and distributing space among items in a container, making it easier to design complex layouts without the need for floats or positioning.

Key Concepts
Main Axis and Cross Axis: Flexbox operates along two axes:
Main Axis: The primary axis along which flex items are arranged (either horizontally or vertically).
Cross Axis: The axis perpendicular to the main axis.
Flex Container and Flex Items:
A flex container is an element with a display property set to flex or inline-flex.
The direct children of this container are called flex items.
